Dev Knowledge Hub

A centralized personal learning space where I explore mobile development, backend, software architecture, data science, and algorithms — all in one organized, scalable, and continuously evolving repository.

🎯 Purpose

📌 Expand technical knowledge across multiple stacks

🧪 Experiment with architectures, patterns, and best practices

🔍 Strengthen fundamentals in algorithms & data structures

🚀 Build small hands-on demos to reinforce concepts

📚 Store roadmaps, notes, and study summaries

🎯 Track long-term growth as a full-stack & mobile engineer
